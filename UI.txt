App Flow Overview
Onboarding (Permissions) → 2. Dashboard (Home) → 3. Network List (Management) → 4. Settings (Preferences)

Screen 1: The "Permission Prime" (Onboarding)
Since Android 10+ requires strict permissions for Wi-Fi scanning, this screen is critical. It must explain "Why" before asking.

Visual: Clean, dark background with the App Logo pulsating in the center.

Headline: "Take Control of Your Connection."

Body Text: "To intelligently switch networks, SmartWifi needs permission to scan your location and manage your Wi-Fi connection."

Action Buttons (Stacked):

"Grant Location Access" (Status: Red 'X' → turns to Green Checkmark when done).

"Grant Wi-Fi Control" (Status: Red 'X' → Green Checkmark).

"Let's Go" (Appears only after permissions are granted).

Screen 2: The "Command Center" (Home Screen)
The main screen. It visualizes the "Triangle Logic" (Wi-Fi vs. Hotspot vs. Data).

Header:

Left: App Name "SmartWifi".

Right: Master Toggle Switch (ON/OFF) – Turns the whole automation engine on or off.

Center Visual (The Radar):

A large circular "Radar" animation.

Center Text: Shows the Current Network Name (e.g., "Office_Floor2").

Sub-text: Real-time stats: "-55dBm | 5GHz".

Visual Cues:

Green Ring: Internet is Verified (Ping Success).

Yellow Ring: Internet Unstable.

Red Ring: No Internet (Searching...).

The "Triangle" Status Bar (Below Radar):

Three icons arranged horizontally. The active source is highlighted; others are dimmed.

Icon 2: Hotspot (Car/Travel).

Icon 3: 4G/5G (Mobile Data).

Quick Action Cards (Bottom Half):

Gaming Mode: Toggle Button (Icon of a Gamepad). Text: "Pause scanning when gaming."

Data Fallback: Toggle Button (Icon of 4G). Text: "Use Mobile Data if Wi-Fi fails."

Network Speed: Shows current Link Speed (e.g., "Speed: 120Mbps").

Screen 3: Network Manager (The Priority List)
Where users manage their saved networks and set priorities.

Tabs at Top: [Saved Networks] | [Blacklist] | [Probation]

List View (Saved Networks Tab):

Each row shows a saved SSID.

Visual Indication: Signal Bars icon next to each name.

Action: A "Star" icon next to each network.

Gold Star: Priority 1 (VIP) – Always connect to this if available.

Grey Star: Standard – Connect if signal is good.

Long Press: Option to "Move to Blacklist" or "Ignore."

Probation Tab (Crucial for Hotspots):

Shows networks that are currently "Paused" because they had No Internet.

Example Item: "Ali_iPhone (Paused for 01:30s)".

Button: "Retry Now" (Manually force a re-check).

Screen 4: Advanced Settings (The Brain)
Where the user fine-tunes the algorithms.

Section 1: Switching Sensitivity

Slider: "Conservative" <--------> "Aggressive".

Conservative: Holds onto Wi-Fi longer.

Aggressive: Switches the moment a slightly better signal is found.

Section 2: Mobile Data Logic

Toggle: "Use Mobile Data assistance."

Threshold: "Switch to data if Wi-Fi speed is below..." (User selects: 1Mbps, 5Mbps, etc.).

Section 3: Gaming Mode Setup

"Select Games": Opens a sub-screen list of all installed apps. User checks the boxes for apps (PUBG, Zoom, etc.) that should trigger "Do Not Disturb" mode.

Section 4: Battery Saver

Toggle: "Geofencing." (Only scan aggressively when at Home/Office locations).

Screen 5: The "Heads Up" Notification (Foreground Service)
Since the app runs in the background, this notification is always visible in the Android notification shade.

Compact View:

Left: SmartWifi Icon (Green dot if active).

Text: "Auto-Switching Active."

Sub-text: "Connected to: Office_Floor1 (-60dBm)".

Action Buttons (on the notification itself):

[Lock Network]: Stops scanning and locks the current Wi-Fi (useful if the user wants to stay put).

[Gaming Mode]: Quick toggle to pause scans.
